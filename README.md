# check-yo-self

Check Yo'Self is a basic task management application designed for a user to replace all the sticky notes they have lying around with a dynamic desktop application. This was my final project for Module 1 at Turing School of Software and Design.

## Objective and Purpose

The goal of this assignment was to not only create a website that visually aligned with a provided layout comp, but to also implement a responsive design that can take the application from desktop to mobile devices with ease. Furthermore, this application utilizes objects and classes as an introduction to OOP. In addition, funtionality was implemented in order to aid the user in organization via checking off tasks, searching for list titles, and marking specific to-do lists as urgent.

## Process

Check Yo'Self implements HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The basic layout is comprised of a single HTML file and accompanying CSS. With the implementation of media queries, the layout adjusts for different screen sizes to ensure user ease.

Through the use of JavaScript, the application allows a certain level of customization to the user experience. There is no minimum or maximum length of a to-do list. The user has the option to mark tasks complete, which will save in real-time, and also designate specific lists as urgent. A user is only able to delete their to-do list once all tasks have been marked as completed. The user is also able to search for and locate a single to-do list by its title, further maximizing organization potential.
